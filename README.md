* The goal of this project is to think NOSQL and model relationships in dynamodb by modeling Linkedin users' posts, likes, and comments. When modelling  is finished, we will populate the tables with fake users who are writing posts and several users who are liking and commenting on posts. All of those access patterns will be attempted to model, and in the end, we hope to create an aggreation pipeline that shows how many likes and comments are present for a given post. We will attempt this using Streams, where we will stream those events in near real time and create a new dynamodb table where these stats are uploaded.
